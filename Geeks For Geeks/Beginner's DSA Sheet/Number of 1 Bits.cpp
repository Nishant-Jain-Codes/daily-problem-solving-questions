/*
Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
2
Explanation:
Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
8
Output:
1
Explanation:
Binary representation is '1000' 
So the count of the set bit is 1.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function setBits() which takes an Integer N and returns the count of number of set bits.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109

// solution 

int setBits(int N) {
        // Write Your Code here
        if(N==0)
            return 0;
        else
            return 1+setBits(N&(N-1));
    }
